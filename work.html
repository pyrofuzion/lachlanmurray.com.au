      <p class="introduction">Below is a timeline of some of the highlights from my year-long adventure as a freelance designer. This endeavour enabled me to do what I love while working with many inspiring and passionate individuals. The level of ambition and enthusiasm that was within every single client that I worked for was deeply impressive and I am humbled to have been invited to be part of the foundational moments of their journeys. Enjoy these glimpses into the stories of some very special people.</p>

        <h4>Mustard Seed Art Studio & Gallery</h4>
        <h5>Brand + print</h5>
        <p>Where it all began. My first client. Vicki reached out to me to help take her passion project and grow it into something bigger. She planted the seed and I helped water it. Mustard Seed was founded on the idea of building a space where everyone—no matter the skill level—could explore their creativity. Vicki has built just that: a place where imagination can flourish. Nestled in the Tuggeranong Valley, Mustard Seed offers a variety of art classes and workshops as well as a gallery space that exhibits Vicki’s artistic works. Vicki wished for a brand that communicated her desire to grow anyone into budding artists. Through an inviting colour palette and soft visual elements, Mustard Seed now has a friendly image that is welcoming of all. Thank you, Vicki. Thank you for giving me a chance and for being my first client.</p>
