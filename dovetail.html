        <p class="project-description">Many apartment complexes offer a variety of shared spaces for their residents but understanding when these spaces are available to use can be tricky. Dovetail lets residents book these spaces, ensuring that there won't be any awkward moments when another group arrives at the barbeque area at the same time as you do.</p>

        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
        <h4>A seamless sign-up experience that doesn't leave anyone behind</h4>
        <p>By assigning a unique code to each unit, the onboarding experience becomes easy as Dovetail knows which apartment complex the user belongs to. This also means that if a tenant's lease expires or the owner sells their property, the new occupant can enter the code assigned to that unit and the previous occupant's account will be revoked. If a resident lives in the unit with others, they can share an invite with their fellow occupants so that nobody feels left out.</p>

        <h3>Booking</h3>
        <h4>Making shared spaces feel a little more private</h4>
        <p>Through understanding the pain points of potential users, it was discovered that residents of apartment complexes appreciate the existence of shared spaces but rarely use them. User research highlighted 2 main reasons for this: residents not wanting to share spaces with others at the same time and residents not knowing when spaces would be available. The booking functionality alleviates these concerns, allowing residents to reserve spaces while providing visibility of when spaces will be occupied.</p>

        <h3>Messaging</h3>
        <h4>These neighbours will let you borrow a cup of sugar</h4>
        <p>The message board encourages residents to get to know each other and to create a sense of community. Whether you're looking to organise an event, reconnect with lost property, or ask for help with something, the group chat functionality can help. Building management can also use this channel to keep everyone in the loop by notifying residents of important announcements.</p>
