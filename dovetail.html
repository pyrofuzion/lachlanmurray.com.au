        <p class="project-description">Many apartment complexes offer a variety of shared spaces for their residents but understanding when these spaces are available to use can be tricky. Dovetail lets residents book these spaces, ensuring that there won't be any awkward moments when another group arrives at the barbeque area at the same time as you do.</p>

        <h3>ONBOARDING</h3>
        <h4>A seamless sign up experience that doesn't leave anyone behind</h4>
        <p>Through assigning an access code to each unit, the onboarding experience becomes easy as Dovetail knows which apartment complex the user belongs to. This also means that if a tenant's lease expires or the occupant sells their property, the new tenant can enter the code assigned to that unit and the previous tenant's account will be revoked. If a tenant lives in the unit with others, they can share an invite with their fellow occupants so that nobody is left feeling left out.</p>
